# Counting the Number of Characters

Create a program that prompts for an input string and dis-
plays output that shows the input string and the number of
characters the string contains.

## Example Output

```
 What is the input string? Homer
 Homer has 5 characters.
```
## Constraints
- Be sure the output contains the original string.
- Use a single output statement to construct the output.
- Use a built-in function of the programming language to
determine the length of the string.

## Challenges

-If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter
something into the program.
