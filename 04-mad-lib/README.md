<h1 align="center">Mad Lib</h1>

Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story tem-
plate with blanks for words. You, or another player, then
construct a list of words and place them into the story, cre-
ating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun,
a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a
story that you create.

## Example Output

```
 Enter your nickname: John
 Enter your age: 20
 Enter your gender: male

 Hey John!
 A 20 year old male guy like you sniffs code daily.
 That's hilarious!
 
```

## Constraints

- Use a single output statement for this program.
- If your language supports string interpolation or string
substitution, use it to build up the output.
