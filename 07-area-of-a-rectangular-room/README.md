# Area of a Rectangular Room

When working in a global environment, you’ll have to
present information in both metric and Imperial units. And
you’ll need to know when to do the conversion to ensure
the most accurate results.

Create a program that calculates the area of a room. Prompt
the user for the length and width of the room in feet. Then
display the area in both square feet and square meters.

## Example Output

````
 What is the length of the room in feet? 15
 What is the width of the room in feet? 20

    You entered dimensions of 15 feet by 20 feet.
    The area is
    300 square feet
    24 square meters

````

>Basic formula for conversion: 1ft = 0.3m 

## Constraints

- Keep the calculations separate from the output.
- Use a constant to hold the conversion factor.
