<h1 align="center">Simple Math</h1>

You’ll often write programs that deal with numbers. And
depending on the programming language you use, you’ll
have to convert the inputs you get to numerical data types.

Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Print the
sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers as
shown in the example output:

## Example Output

````
 What is the first number? 10
 What is the second number? 5

    10 + 5 = 15

    10 - 5 = 5

    10 * 5 = 50

    10 / 5 = 2

````

## Constraints

- Values coming from users will be strings. Ensure that
you convert these values to numbers before doing the
math.
- Keep the inputs and outputs separate from the numerical
conversions and other processing.
- Generate a single output statement with line breaks in
the appropriate spots.
