# Simple Math

You’ll often write programs that deal with numbers. And
depending on the programming language you use, you’ll
have to convert the inputs you get to numerical data types.

Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Print the
sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers as
shown in the example output:

## Example Output

````
 What is the first number? 10
 What is the second number? 5

    10 + 5 = 15

    10 - 5 = 5

    10 * 5 = 50

    10 / 5 = 2

````

## Constraints

- Values coming from users will be strings. Ensure that
you convert these values to numbers before doing the
math.
- Keep the inputs and outputs separate from the numerical
conversions and other processing.
- Generate a single output statement with line breaks in
the appropriate spots.
