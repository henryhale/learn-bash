## Introduction 

This repo is based on a book titled: **Exercises for Programmers: 57 challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills** by **_Brian P. Hogan_**, edited by _Susannah Davidson Pfalzer_.

The book can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Premalatha-success/Books-Python/blob/main/57%20Exercises%20for%20Programmers.pdf).

> "_This book is all about practicing your craft as a programmer.
>Flip to a page in this book, crack open your text editor, and
>hammer out the program. Make your own variations on it.
>Do it in a language you’ve never used before. And get better
>and better each time you do it._"

## Why?

I qoute some of the most motivational statements I've ever read:

> _"The best software developers I’ve ever met approach their
>craft the same way. They don’t go to work every day and
>practice on the employer’s dime. They invest personal time
>in learning new languages and perfecting techniques in
>others. Of course they learn new things on the job, but
>because they’re getting paid, there’s an expectation that they
>are there to perform, not practice."_

Most important of all...

>_"But that’s the real value of these
>exercises; they’ll help you learn a language and how that
>language is different from what you already know."_
