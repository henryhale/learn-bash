<h1 align="center">Printing Qoutes</h1>

Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end
of a string. But sometimes we need to print out the quotation
marks themselves by using escape characters.

Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.
Display the quotation and author as shown in the example
output.

## Example Output

```
 What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
 Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
 Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids
you're looking for."
```

## Constraints

- Use a single output statement to produce this output,
using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.

- If your language supports string interpolation or string
substitution, donâ€™t use it for this exercise. Use string
concatenation instead.
