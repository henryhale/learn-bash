At some point, you might have to deal with currency
exchange rates, and youâ€™ll need to ensure your calculations
are as precise as possible.

Write a program that converts currency. Specifically, convert
euros to U.S. dollars. Prompt for the amount of money in
euros you have, and prompt for the current exchange rate
of the euro. Print out the new amount in U.S. dollars.

## Example

 [$] Currency Converter 

 [-] 1 EURO = 1.037 DOLLARS

 How many euros are you exchanging? 100

 100 euros is equivalent to 103.73 dollars.
