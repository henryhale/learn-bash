Sometimes you have to round up to the next number rather
than follow standard rounding rules.

Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a
room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one
gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons
needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.

## Example Output
